W3C validation â€“ both HTML and CSS, as well as image compression where applicable. 
All forms must contain javascript validation that is fully functional.
Forms are NOT to rely on html5 validation. All images, embedded maps, slideshows etc are to be responsive in nature. 
It is expected that the website be viewable across multiple types of devices.
